K8s uses privileged containers on a Linux environment (these are known as HostProcess Pods on Windows v1.22)


*kube-proxy is a privileged container in a Linux system can manage iptables rules for routing traffic to applications*


**flow:**

Dockefile for DB:
```
FROM alpine:3.15.4
RUN apk add --no-cache mysql
ENTRYPOINT ['/usr/bin/mysqld']
```

Dockefile  for app:
```
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /myapp
COPY src/requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY src /myapp
CMD [ 'python', 'mysql-custom-client.py' ]
```

`$docker build ==> $docker push`

k8s manifest.yaml:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: core-k8s
  spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-mysql-server
      image: myregistry.com/mysql-server:v1.0

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: core-k8s-mysql
  spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-sqlclient
      image: myregistry.com/mysql-custom-client:v1.0
      command: ['tail','-f','/dev/null']
```

`$kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml`

An immutable operating system is one in which some, or all, of the operating system file systems, are read-only, and cannot be changed.

images are not patched or updated but replaced atomically 

it's natural to run k8s on immutable OS (talos)



*K8s arch*

k8s api resources :

`kubectl api-resources | head`


# DO NOT USE K8S WHEN:
        - HPC: high performance computing
        - Legacy
        - Migrationâ€”Implementations: mono straight to k8s
